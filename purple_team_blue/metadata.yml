id: 511985c4-2a6c-4b3e-9c2f-e8d1a12a3f72 # Placeholder - A unique UUID4 should be generated for a new rule
status: experimental
description: Detects TTPs used by UNC3944 (Scattered Spider) threat actor, specifically targeting a Windows developer endpoint. This rule focuses on activities related to OS credential dumping, particularly from LSASS memory (T1003.001), and the unauthorized use or installation of legitimate remote access software such as ScreenConnect or AnyDesk (T1219) to maintain persistence and control.
